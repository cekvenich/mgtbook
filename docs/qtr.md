# Quarterly

End of Quarter will have few with low 3/4 productivity. And this is not a time to be doing hiring or onboarding. That is for the rest of the quarter, so block of the weeks around the EOQ (end of quarter). Think of is as a 'bio-break' (going to the bathroom).

## Exec newsletter

Few weeks before EOQ, most of the IC's and all the senior engineers need to do self marketing. The report/newsletter will be aggregate and typeset into an infographic style PDF, including profile pics/avatars. Topics include, by product/project/customer:
- KPI
- OKR results
- Productivity metrics or github's LOC
- Product roadmap complected past qtr. 
- Spotlight: a place to showcase impactful project
- Business generated/supported. ( eg. SEO generated 20 leads per day and we support 10K transactions per day, but in a nice type of a chart)
- Headcount
- Number of VM instances. List of vendors and services used. (eg. Monitoring)
Avoid using technical terms. 
- Budgets are percentages, eg. we used 22% of the annual budget in this quarter.

    NOTE: This quarterly exec report is the most important task for VPE, a bit of expense justification. 

You may need to create a half page version of this newsletter that the CEO can present to investors.

    NOTE: Most of the time the CEO is bullshitting the investors. In any case, in order to do your job, you need to spend up to 50% of your time managing up, making sure you are aligning yourself to the CEO's vision. It is not easy keeping the quarterly newsletter and the half page investor version in sync, and maybe a good idea that they are not in sync. as it may confuse the team. Just smile and listen intently and say only what you have checked with the CEO. Being a martyry is immature. When you can't control a situation, what you do control is how you act and you need to act like a plant and head for the door ASAP.


## 360/1:1

Also a few weeks before EOQ everyone does 360's.
Following completion of 360's manager do 1:1 w/ direct reports, were you review the feed back each employee received from peers in the 360s.
During these you'll get good ideas on how to improve the org or other things to do. It is important to act on these tasks, and to manage to complete them before the next quarter. Otherwise what is the point of having 1:1 if nothing changes, am I right. You want to actively solicit and then implement the best ideas.  

    NOTE: As a part of a management, make sure you give employees something to believe in.

## Promote within 

Promote from within to reward longevity and loyalty. Most employees stay for only a few years, and that is very expensive.

    NOTE: Who to promote? If you promote someone who would like to be a manager, you'll get a bad manager - since they will try to add value to the developers. If you promote someone who does not want to manage, you'll get a good manager. Mostly people that are not interested in promotion do well.



## Firing protected class

In USA we have some protected classes, such as military or other protected classes. Military people also do make some of the best performers, but nothing is 100%. Same procedure as above. Be generous with severance due to potential of an impact of a lawsuit that would be difficult to win in most courts. Or you can decide to keep someone to be just a mascot, maybe they are funny at team building events. Most ICs realize what is going on, why a poor performer is still around. Or convert them into a remote consultant to work on special projects. What you don't want to have is politics in the org.


# Plan next quarter

At start of quarter finish the plan for the next OKR goals for sr. eng and above. Also, based on the stress/load tests you want to plan the capacity for the next quarter, and in general manage costs. Cut what not adding value, and experiment with things that have a quick ROI. For sure you have padded your annual budget and are under it each and every quarter so that you have reserve budget and so that each future quarter has a bit more than the prior one. You want to avoid cutting budget due to overspending. A big part of panning next budget is following the quarterly sales revenue projection fo the next quarter.


# Tests

Also, make sure you perform a realistic disaster recovery simulation drill. For example restore you backups to another vendor, and shut off primary vendor. If a disaster ever happened, it is something you practiced for.
