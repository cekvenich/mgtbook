# How to leave as a tech manager

It is important to have someone, or a few people, or even most of the people be able to give you a good reference - that they like you. Being a hard or a smart worker is not the same as having a good reference - that they like you. Also important, even more important, is that you worked for name brad companies. If you have on your bio a company no one ever heard of, it is almost a minus.

This way when you move to future jobs your profile looks attractive. 

## When to leave

If there is a time when you think that you won't get a good reference, that is the time to mentally check out. You should now work part time and hide it, but look for a new job full time.
When you get a start date, schedule a vacation at your old job to make sure you'll like your new job.
And again, you job should be at a brand name company. Once at a new job, make sure you'll get a good reference.

## Big advantage 

It becomes quickly obvious that having a network, support or a second source of income is helpful. For example, if you served in the military with ROTC, it gives you these advantages.
Or having a name brand school, eg: HBS, MIT, as your network. Or if you did not plan ahead, having cashflow positive rental income. This reduces stress at work and therefore allows you to be more effective. One way to have a second source of income is selling digital goods, like a software program that you wrote and maintain via some remote developer you hired.
