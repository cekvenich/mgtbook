# How to get hired as a tech manager


## Most important: Be likeable.


## Things that *DON'T* work
Talking to recruiters or HR is time consuming and unlikely to result in any benefit. If you are not talking to the hiring manager or execs, you are having your time wasted.
Also, any kind of a coding test means they just want to bump you.  A good way to decline is: 
'I read someplace that this is not a good path for me to get hired there, so I respectfully decline. 
Let me know if can help you recruit someone or if you need some part time interim consulting while you hire your perfect match'.

    *NOTE*: One way to get a consulting Purchase Order signed is to offer money back if *YOU* think that you did not add value of a certain $ amount. For me, I say if I think I did not add at least $100K of value in two weeks of consulting I won't invoice the PO other than the expenses.
    
## Source of opportunities

Best source of opportunities is investors. You can network with the by reviewing and doing due diligence of companies. Another source of opportunities is consulting, management consulting, such as 'red-team' review.
Since opportunities are rare, care must be taken to leverage each rare opportunity, no mistakes.

## Maybe a good approach is to list what *NOT* to do if you want to get hired:

## - Don't embarrass the management


The goal is not to indicate to the hiring manager that you'll embarrass them after you are hired!!!

Interview question: ' How would you design an app with a spec like ours ? '

1. Do not say you would stress test the app.

2. Do not say you would test the security of the app.

3. Do not say you would make it deterministic.

4. Do not talk about anything innovative or innovation. 

5. Don't share your code github, it is always less than prefect. You can just clone some popular repo and look cool. 

    *NOTE*: You must have two public personas/IDs, one real/private handle and one public/generic!

Likely, they are not doing things like this. You can try and help them fix it: *AFTER* you get the job, and *AFTER* you have developed trust with the upper management. If you act to fix before you have the trust of upper management you will not be effective. As a part of emotional maturity, it is OK to allow people to be wrong. Sometimes most important thing is to hear and *NOT* answer. Other times you need to show that you care, instead of attempting to address the issue. The only exception is, if the org. has 'Diversity' resources or pronouns, likely not worth working there.


Also, the goal is to get the offer. Only once you have the offer should you consider if you should take it or no.

And last, in this profession it is typically that you are in school till you are 25 years old and that 20 years later you'll be considered to old, so at 45 you maybe forced into a career change. It works like chess GM's, strong in 20's and fade in 40s.
That is what a STEM degree gives you, if you wanted longevity go into sales, business or finance. 



## MBA type

There are two types of tech managers, and MBA-type or techie types. MBA-types are managers that have superficial hands on experience in tech. Think of an NBA coach that never played pro ball, but did play school JV ball, maybe a few years of bench warming. The MBA-type managers manage by hearsay. For example they ask dev A and then they ask dev B - and that is how they make decisions, based on who talks the loudest. It is difficult for them to be effective leaders and may end up destroying the team and productivity. They are good at playing politics because they have nothing to do, becuase there is nothing the can do, so they are free for 40 hours per week to play politics. 


    Note: I define politics as not being able to call out someone who is incompetent. 


The other type is a software engineer that has shipped product before, worked as a sr. engineer and had project failures. Maybe they had worked for a bad manager in the past. Having sailed some rough seas is a plus.

This 'guide/book' is meant for the technical kind and not for the MBA-type. The MBA type could be effective at being an analyst and product manager - if they are kept busy.
