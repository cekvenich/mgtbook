## Architectural decisions

Sometimes a team needs you to help the team decide between architecture A and B. Good way is to have each champion implement A and B in less than a few hours and then do some objective measurement agreed upon ahead of it. Usually the best implementation is the one that wins over the architecture.


## Hiring

One of the things that managers spend a lot of time is hiring. Sometimes you can work with HR admins, but you must never rely on them, a lot of the times recruiters and HR are impediments to hiring the best candidate. The managers select the people to talk to, for example on Upwork, and the managers are the ones that do the first interview. You may need to budget 50% of your most precisions resource, your time on recruiting. Once you have selected a few candidates for the opening, the managers manager should select the best candidate. You don't want to have a manager not hire the best candidate due to them being threated. 

    HIRING TIPS: Technical interview is an ego trip. Mostly you want good candidates to join and if they don't work out deal with it then. I am OK with hiring people that are a high performance and a bit harder to manage - as a trade off. Most of the time I'm not paying the FAANG salaries, but I still want A level people. There are no engineers who are good but don't know their net worth. 

## On-boarding

Onboarding needs to include formalized training. The two onboarding weeks are most critical part of the employment, this is where you can make a good candidate into a bad employee and an OK hire into a superstar. Onboarding is prepared before you start the hire process.

## Projectized accounting

You not only need to track how much you spend on AWS and payroll, but what project / client you spent it on. Monthly you need to break down the actual costs and man-days spent on projects / client.

## Segregation

A female developer wrote a blog, now I can't find it. She said she was going trough university CS, mostly male. At some point, there was a an opportunity presented for females. She said she has never before felts so alone. As a manager, treat people individually based on the content of their character.


## Retention

My impression is that majority of people are badly managed. And I read studies that people leave because of a bad direct manager. So all you have to is be a good manager. I'd say great is the enemy of good. And put in the effort of effort of each IC. As a manager you have to be consistently correct 100% of time. Your ICs will only remember the 1% of time you made a mistake. 


## Problem employee

Some people are very productive and harder to manage. That is why you need good managers who are not defensive because productivity is the most important thing. Don't race sheep, race arabian hot blooded thoroughbreds.

# Office Politics

Politics is usually incompetence that you can't call out or some kind of grift/embezzlement. That is how it should be treated, documented and reported, including reported externally. 


# Temporary problems

Sometimes a good employee will have a bad patch for some personal reason. They must be explicitly told that the org. is there to support them by a high ranking manager and why. (eg. 'because we value your contribution').
