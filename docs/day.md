## Start and 'operation'

Most of the time you are running some agile process. I like 1 week over 2 week 'sprint'. At the end of the week the first level manager's primary responsibility is to communicate to each IC (individual contributor) a list of tasks sufficient for two weeks (yes, you do this each week not every 2 weeks) and the sequential priority order of all the tasks. Ny sequential I mean no two tasks are priority 1, no two tasks are priority 2, etc. And the reason you give them two weeks worth of tasks and not one is that there are plenty of times that high performers do more work than you'd expect. And sometimes, an IC is blocked by a higher priority task, so they start on the next priority task. 

There is nothing more important for a first level manager than having enough defined tasks communicated at the of the week. If someone does not have enough for 2 weeks worth of tasks, then fire the IC due to lack of sufficient work to keep them busy or fire the first line manager immediately for cause: not doing their job. There is no possible excuse for this. If you don't fire the first line manager on the spot, then top management must immediately fire the middle manager that failed to fire the first level manager. All this happens at the end of the week, so we have a clean start to the start of the week.

The first hour of the first day of the week is the most important, the ICs have defined tasks that they understand the requirements and the priority of the tasks. To have a good week, the start of the week must be good. And that first hour of the week was set at the end of the prior week above.

At the end of the day each IC usually submits a very short status, and the manager checks effort level, for example by glancing the github commits for the day. Each IC should be able to do a few things per day. Sometimes the first line manager adjusts the priority of the tasks at the end of the day. For example, a bug came in, it gets added, and it may have a higher priority bumping down the priority of other tasks for an IC.

   NOTE: During the week do not miss an opportunity to offer a specific compliment to IC or first level managers.

## Towards the end of the week

Wednesday night IC's submit some longer report or demo of what they worked on, including their plan for the rest of the week. Due to remote work, these IC reports can't be done later in the week.  Thursday AM the first line manager passes on the IC reports to the 'Product Manager'(PM). The PM the reviews their quarterly product road map and communicates the current short term priorities with the first line manager. There is a bit of parallel work here since it is not 100% clear on Thursday as to what the complected work will be for the entire week, but it should be close enough to guess. Thursday night you'll get another set of IC reports with any ambiguity removed. 
Assuming individual IC had a good week, Friday I set to half day and don't ask for a status report on Friday - people's minds are on the weekend. 

   NOTE: What I push is for is a good start to the week and good week, and at the end of the week I stop pushing to accelerate - so everyone has a good week.

   NOTE: One thing I have seen work well is where the tech lead is also the product manager.

The first line manager at the end of the week prepares the next week, and the rhythm repeats. As your prepare the priorities for next week keep in career gaols of ICs in mind.


## Celling vs floor management

Notice that I never give minimals of amount of tasks to be completed by any IC for the week. 
Managing for the floor makes you waste calories playing games against the IC on estimates and commitment. Instead I manage for the ceiling: do as much as you can in good faith. As a manager I facilitate performance by removing as much of the stress as possible. Of course some people are highly productive and they will much more than expected. If there are low performers, that becomes obvious and they can be removed from the team over time. High performers don't want to cary dead weight.

   IMPORTANT: Team will perform at its best once trust in management is established. After that you can establish expectations of high performance.

   MANAGEMENT TIP: During the week you should find specific things you can compliment and informally track the # of compliments per employee till you get to 10 compliments. Because the ration of compliments to coaching should be greater than 10. Once you coach someone, that count/reservoir of good will is now 0 again. If you are not giving positive feedback IC will start to wonder.

## Product releases

Software releases should happen throughout the working day and not towards the end of the week before the weekend.

   NOTE: e2e testing is something Senior/Lead engineers lead in, with others such as QA supporting. More, modern testing is using 'testing in production' techniques. 

Also, things related to IAM, auth and security are usually the most time consuming and laborious.

## No other managers

Sometimes IC have more managers:
- HR
- Office Manager
- Product Manager
- Project manager/Scrum master
- The boss's boss 2 levels above them
- Customer support manager
- Customer
etc.

All these other managers must exclusively interface to the IC via IC's first line manager whose goal is to protect them.  In some orgs, software engineers are the low man on the totem pole and anyone and everyone outranks them. The first line manager should fill out any needed forms for his team. The team should be busy working. Care for your team and they will take care of your customers.


## Personal

I personally exercise first thing in the day after drinking a glass of water and before reading any emails. This helps me sleep and have energy. Also, I write done a few things I want to do that day; - BEFORE reading emails.
