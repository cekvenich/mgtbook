# VPE engineering leadership mentoring guide

## Tech (software engineering) manager (VPE or Dir Eng) for a techie 

It is said that there are two jobs in a company, making things, or selling things.
Currently, and in the coming age, where the 'software will eat the world', the making is done by a tech manager, eg. VPE. For example you may think the Tesla product is car, and it is not, it is an embedded system. Basically, Tesla's product is a linux motherboard.

There are two types of tech managers, and MBA-type or techie types. MBA-types are trained managers that have superficial understanding of tech. Think of an NBA coach that never played pro ball, but did play school ball and read a book. The MBA-type managers manage by hearsay, and are never effective leaders and end up destroying the team and productivity. They are good at bleeding their org and playing politics.

The other type is a software engineer that has shipped product before, worked as a sr. engineer and had project failures. Maybe they had worked for a bad manager in the past. Having sailed some rough seas is a plus.

This 'guide/book' is meant for the technical kind and not for the MBA-type.

So for example, I won't be address MBA-type issue such as MBA-type hiring a dev-shop based primarily on the hourly bill rate.
