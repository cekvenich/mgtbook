# Your first week as a leader

## First

Your first job is to connect to the your bosses(eg. one of either: CEO, BOD, CTO, VPE, CFO) on a personal and social level, showing you care. You will not get anything done unless you grab onto their coat tails. Is it ass kissing? No, it is understanding their value system, and understanding what personal things they want to achieve, and what their social circle is.  If you don't level up here, you won't get much of anything done. Once you have that achievement unlocked, make sure you overact to your bosses communications, and that your boss has positive anecdotes to share to his/her social circle. 

To do above, you'll need to be of value to them personally. What I do to show value is quietly demonstrate my work ethics. Quiet example: 'I did a write up report/summary of such and such and put it in the wiki'. Not quiet: 'It took me 18 hours over the weekend to bla bla'

## Second

I also start building report with key customers, and peers (eg. VP marketing )

## Last, the easy part

Managing down is easy. You need to id the the leaders. I use github tools to find who are those 'shadow leaders' in effort, that I'll be pushing up.

I do also push down people that can not demonstrate effort to their peers - but before I push them down I wait for a 360 review cycle to see how the peers see everyone, a bit of a submarine echo locator.

Tools similar to this will ID the leaders in your org. I think of it as the police and the mafia. As managers, we are the police and give guidance. The mafia/leads then decide what they'll do based on the given guidance.
