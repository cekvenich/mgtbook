## Levels and Career path

Once your org is has over 25 you'll need salary levels/lader. And a career path, from-to, you do want to have retention longer than a few years. The cost to replace domain knowledge is ~ 5 months salary. Here is an example to get you going, here someone can stay with the org for 25 years and leave at 50 with a nice 401K.

- Backend services and event buss .jr Dev  ->

## Innovation

At least annually you should invest in training. For example sports teams train regularly and so do orchestra. Obviously this should be things that are aligned with long term direction of the company, it does not need to be something with short term alignment. (eg. One popular initiative is digital transformation where every person in the company is able to write an application)

You should considering a hackathon in the area of strategic direction, jugged by sales people.


## Travel 

With the remote work, it may make sense for regional meetings with top management. For example if you have developers all over Easter Europe, have everyone come into (eg. St. Petersburg from White nights).
Important is to work during that week, where you demonstrate you work ethic to the team for the entire week. Get a large conference room or such have have everyone continue to work on a sprint. 


## 3 years

Ever few years you should come up with long term goal for the business. For example gor revenue by N percent. 

    NOTE: As an exec. I have seen orgs that have secondary goals fail.
