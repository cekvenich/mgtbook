## Firing

If there are people with poor reviews, 'this is your last day with us, at this point in your career it does not fit here'. Once team realizes somone  has poor performance via 360's its time for them to go. Or anytime someone's poor performance impacts another employee. In case of some 'situation' than both parties are let go. 
Doing PIPs is a waste, putting people under stress always lowers performance.

    NOTE: Of course you need to back up everything, review any network device settings and change all the passwords afterwards. It has happened to me that a fired person afterwards changed the network settings.
